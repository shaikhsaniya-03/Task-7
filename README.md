# Task7 : Creating VIEWS
  In databases, a view acts as a virtual table derived from one or more base tables. It simplifies querying, enhances security, and improves data management. Views can hide complexity by pre-defining complex joins or calculations, restrict access to sensitive data, and provide a consistent interface for users.
  
  __Syntax :__ CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT col1, col2 FROM table_name ;
